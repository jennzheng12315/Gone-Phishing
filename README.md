First time player? I highly recommend exploring the game before reading further down this README.  

## 💡 Intro
  
In her book, *Inventing the Medium: Principles of Interaction Design as a Cultural Practice*, Janet Murray explores how designers can exploit users’ affordances of a digital medium to provide a positive experience. Many companies also use affordances to create a great UX for their products. I, however, wanted to see if I could keep users engaged while using their affordances against them. Thus, Gone Phishing was born.
  
## 📋 About the Project

--Insert text about project here. Don't forget images/screenshots/gifs--
When creating Gone Phishing, I chose to focus on three affordances of a hypertext game: readability, working links, and solvable challenges. 

Other features that usurp user expectations and affordances:
* The casual title, "Gone Phishing," and the simplistic design aims to misdirect users and adds to the surprise of a hacking
* In most games, users expect that all, or nearly all, items must have a reason to exist. However, in Gone Phishing, most items have no purpose at all.

## 📌 Next Steps
* Add sound effects
* Make a transition from fishing game to hacking
* Explore more design possibilities for the game
* Add more obstacles and/or objects such as keys that have no purpose
* Get feedback for improvements and the impact of poor affordances on UX
