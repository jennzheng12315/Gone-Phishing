**First time player? I highly recommend exploring the game before reading further down this README.**  

## üí° Intro
  
In her book, *Inventing the Medium: Principles of Interaction Design as a Cultural Practice*, Janet Murray explores how designers can exploit users‚Äô affordances of a digital medium to provide a positive experience. Many companies also use affordances to create a great UX for their products. I, however, wanted to see if I could keep users engaged while using their affordances against them. Thus, Gone Phishing was born.

## üìã About the Project

When creating Gone Phishing, I chose to focus on three affordances of a hypertext game: readability, working navigational links, and solvable challenges. The first two are important to the medium, hypertext, and the third plays a large role in game design. 

### Readability
Upon entering the maze, users encounter a mostly blank screen. The black words against a black background adds to the setting of the story and challenges their affordance of being able to read text in a hypertext game. After they figures out that they can highlight the words with their mouse and once they find a flashlight, the text color changes to a light yellow. 

Furthermore, one chest can only be unlocked if users can decipher what appears to be a strange collection of letters. Upon closer examiniation, they may notice that the text is backwards and is asking for the answer to a riddle.

### Working navigational links
Once users begin the game and discover that their computer has been hacked, they recieve a "Quit Game" link that allows them to quit the game, which is a typical response to many people who find themselves in this situation. However, However, users will find that the unseen person will not allow them to leave, and if they look at the navigation bar, they will find that they cannot use a back or forward arrow. By going against their expectations, it adds to the surprise and takes away some of the users‚Äô sense of control (though not all of it since they can still close the window). They are forced to continue the story and eventually enter the maze.

### Solvable Challenges
At the end of the maze, users are surprised by a monster blocking the exit, and they have ten seconds to select the item that will defeat it. The timer creates a sense of urgency and tension as users reach the climax of their experience.  However, no matter what objects they use, they cannot defeat it and eventually receive the message ‚ÄúYou have died." That is because the game is rigged; the unseen person does not want anyone escaping.

### Other features that usurp user expectations and affordances:
* The casual title, "Gone Phishing," and the simplistic design aims to misdirect users and adds to the surprise of a hacking
* In most games, users expect that all, or nearly all, items must have a reason to exist. However, in Gone Phishing, most items have no purpose at all.

Based on the positive feedback I've recieved so far, I've gathered that users did enjoy the game despite the difficulty level (which is to be expected considering the use of poor affordances). Therefore, I would say that Gone Phishing was successful in showing that affordances do not necessarily have to help people to keep them engaged in a digital medium.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes 
* There is a way to exit the maze if you can find it!
* There is actually a way to quit the game too!
* You may find various hints that will lead you to the maze exit if you get lost!

## üìå Next Steps
* Expand upon the poor affordances already included in the game or add more
* Add sound effects
* Make a transition from fishing game to hacking
* Possibly add full screen functionality
* Explore more design possibilities for the game
* Add more obstacles and/or objects such as keys that have no purpose
* Get feedback for improvements and the impact of poor affordances on UX
