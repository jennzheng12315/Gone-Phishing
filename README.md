First time player? I highly recommend exploring the game before reading further down this README.  

## 💡 Intro
  
In her book, *Inventing the Medium: Principles of Interaction Design as a Cultural Practice*, Janet Murray explores how designers can exploit users’ affordances of a digital medium to provide a positive experience. I, however, wanted to see if I could keep users engaged while using their affordances against them, and thus, Gone Phishing was born.
